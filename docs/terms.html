        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to SYNC. By downloading, installing, or using the SYNC app ("the app"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the app.</p>

        <h2>1. About SYNC</h2>
        <p>SYNC is a couples companion app developed by Meherzan Boundless that helps partners stay connected through shared features including mood tracking, date night planning, games, location sharing, photo sharing, and more.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use SYNC. By using the app, you represent that you meet this age requirement. If you are under 18, you must have the consent of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

        <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account (name, email, phone number, FaceTime email).</li>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.</li>
            <li>You must not share your account with others or create multiple accounts.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Partner Connection</h2>
        <p>SYNC is designed for use between two consenting partners. By connecting with another user via an invite code:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You consent to sharing your mood entries, location, photos, and other app content with your connected partner.</li>
            <li>You agree to only connect with someone who has consented to share data with you.</li>
            <li>Either partner may disconnect the pairing at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the app to harass, stalk, or harm any person</li>
            <li>Share content that is illegal, abusive, or violates the rights of others</li>
            <li>Use the SOS or emergency features for non-emergency purposes</li>
            <li>Attempt to access another user's data without authorization</li>
            <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the app</li>
            <li>Use automated systems or bots to interact with the app</li>
            <li>Circumvent any security features or access restrictions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Content You Share</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of all content you create and share through SYNC (photos, videos, messages, mood entries, etc.). By using the app, you grant us a limited license to store, process, and display your content solely for the purpose of providing the app's features to you and your connected partner.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the content you share. We do not monitor or review user content but reserve the right to remove content that violates these Terms.</p>

        <h2>7. SOS and Emergency Features</h2>
        <p>SYNC includes an SOS feature that can initiate phone calls or FaceTime calls to your partner. This feature is provided as a convenience and is <strong>not a substitute for emergency services</strong>. In a genuine emergency, always contact your local emergency services (e.g., 911) directly.</p>
        <p>We make no guarantees about the availability, reliability, or timeliness of the SOS feature.</p>

        <h2>8. Location Sharing</h2>
        <p>If you enable location sharing, your location will be visible to your connected partner in real time. You can disable location sharing at any time through your device settings. We do not track or store historical location data beyond what is needed for the current session.</p>

        <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The SYNC app, including its design, code, logos, and branding, is the property of Meherzan Boundless and is protected by copyright and intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from the app.</p>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms. You may delete your account at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@sync-app.com">support@sync-app.com</a>. Upon termination, your data will be deleted in accordance with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>SYNC is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the app will be available at all times, error-free, or secure. We are not responsible for any damages arising from your use of the app.</p>

        <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the app or via email. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
