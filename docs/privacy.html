        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

        <p>SYNC ("we", "our", or "the app") is a couples companion app built by Meherzan Boundless. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use SYNC.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and FaceTime email. These are required to provide core app functionality.</p>
        <p><strong>Partner Connection:</strong> When you connect with your partner using an invite code, we store the pairing relationship to enable shared features.</p>
        <p><strong>Content You Create:</strong> This includes mood entries, date night plans, shared photos and videos, game activity, manifestation goals, gentle days settings, and messages exchanged between you and your partner within the app.</p>
        <p><strong>Location Data:</strong> With your permission, we collect your location to share it with your connected partner on the map and to enable location-based features like nearby date night suggestions. Location is only accessed while the app is in use.</p>
        <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect push notification tokens to deliver notifications. We do not collect device identifiers for advertising purposes.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain the app's features between you and your partner</li>
            <li>To send push notifications (date reminders, partner activity, SOS alerts)</li>
            <li>To enable the SOS emergency call feature using your stored phone number and FaceTime email</li>
            <li>To display your location to your connected partner on the shared map</li>
            <li>To store and display shared photos, videos, and memories</li>
            <li>To facilitate games, mood tracking, and other couple activities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>Your personal data is shared only with your connected partner within the app. We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your data with third-party advertisers or data brokers.</p>
        <p>We use the following third-party services to operate the app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong> - Authentication, database, and cloud functions</li>

        </ul>
        <p>These services process data on our behalf and are bound by their own privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored securely using Firebase Firestore and MongoDB Atlas, both of which use encryption at rest and in transit. Access to your data is restricted through security rules that ensure only you and your connected partner can access your shared information.</p>
        <p>We implement industry-standard security measures including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
            <li>Firebase Authentication for secure sign-in</li>
            <li>Firestore security rules that enforce data access boundaries</li>
            <li>No storage of passwords in plain text</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>

            <li><strong>Delete</strong> your account and associated data by contacting us</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> for location sharing, notifications, or other permissions through your device settings at any time</li>
        </ul>
